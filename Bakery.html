                    <h3>Scones</h3>
                    <p class="description"> <b>How to Prepare</b>
                        <br>Preheat oven to 220°C (428°F) and position the oven tray in the middle. Line two baking trays with baking paper.
                        <br>Sift flour, salt, and baking powder twice into a large bowl.
                        <br>Cut butter into small blocks and rub into the flour mixture with fingertips until it resembles breadcrumbs, ensuring no lumps of butter remain.
                        <br>Add sugar and mix thoroughly with your hands.
                        <br>In a small bowl, lightly whisk buttermilk and 1 egg. Add this to the flour mixture, mixing with a round-bladed knife. Add water as needed to form a soft, non-sticky dough. Avoid over-mixing.
                        <br>Turn dough onto a floured surface and gently knead until a ball is formed.
                        <br>Pat dough out to about 3 cm thick. Use a round metal cutter to cut out scones, placing them on baking trays with 2-3 cm space between each.
                        <br>Lightly whisk the remaining egg and brush it on top of each scone.
                        <br>Bake for 15 minutes. Check for doneness by cutting one open; if not fully cooked, bake for an additional 3 minutes.

                    <h3>Milk Tart</h3>
                    <p class="description"> <b>How to Prepare</b>
                        <br>To make a milk tart, start by preparing the crust: blend flour, butter, and a bit of sugar until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Press this mixture into the base of a tart pan and bake at 180°C (350°F) for about 10 minutes until lightly golden.
                        <br>For the filling, heat milk in a saucepan until it's almost boiling. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, sugar, and a bit of flour until smooth. <br>Gradually stir the hot milk into this mixture, then return it to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens.
                        <br>Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in vanilla extract. Pour the filling into the pre-baked crust, smoothing it out evenly.
                        <br>Allow the tart to cool to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to set.
                        <br>Once set, sprinkle with a little cinnamon before serving.

                        <br>Combine sugar, water, cinnamon sticks, ground ginger, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and refrigerate to chill.
                        <br>In a large bowl, mix flour, baking powder, and salt.
                        <br>Add butter to the dry ingredients and rub it in with your fingers until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.
                        <br>In a separate bowl, whisk together milk and eggs, then pour into the flour mixture. Stir until a soft dough forms.
                        <br>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about 1cm thick. Cut into strips, then divide each strip into thirds. Braid or plait the pieces, pinching the ends to seal.
                        <br>Heat oil to 180°C in a deep fryer or pot.
                        <br>Fry the koeksisters in batches for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until golden brown. Remove with a slotted spoon.
                        <br>Dunk the hot koeksisters immediately into the cold syrup, making sure they are well coated.
                        <br>Place them on a wire rack set over a tray or plate to drain any excess syrup.

                        <br>Whip eggs and sugar: Beat for 7 minutes until thick, glossy, and tripled in volume.
                        <br> Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually mix into egg mixture in 3 parts, blending briefly.
                        <br> Melt butter in hot milk. Hot milk helps with aeration.
                        <br>Mix some batter into hot milk to temper, then slowly pour back into whipped eggs. Mix briefly.
                        <br>Line 2 cake pans with parchment paper.

                        <br> Cool upside down for flat layers or right side up if you prefer the dome. Frost or serve with your choice of toppings.
